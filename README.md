I'll create a React project that implements a tool for analyzing datasets, identifying data quality issues, and suggesting cleaning actions. This tool will focus on CSV files for simplicity, but the concept can be extended to other data formats.


This React project implements a data quality analysis tool with the following features:

1. File upload: Users can upload a CSV file.
2. Data analysis: The tool analyzes the uploaded data for various quality issues.
3. Report generation: A detailed report is generated, highlighting data quality issues.
4. Cleaning suggestions: The tool provides code snippets (in Python and SQL) for addressing the identified issues.


To use this tool:

1. Upload a CSV file using the file input.
2. The tool will automatically analyze the data and generate a report.
3. The report will show issues related to missing values, outliers, inconsistent formats, and duplicates.
4. For each issue, you'll see Python (using Pandas) and SQL code snippets that you can use to clean the data.


This implementation focuses on CSV files, but you can extend it to support other data formats like JSON or database tables by modifying the `FileUpload` component and the data parsing logic.

To further improve this tool, you could consider:

1. Adding more data quality checks (e.g., data type consistency, value range checks).
2. Implementing data visualization to help users better understand the issues.
3. Adding an option to apply the suggested cleaning actions directly within the tool.
4. Supporting more input formats (JSON, Excel, database connections).
5. Implementing more advanced statistical analysis for outlier detection and data profiling.
